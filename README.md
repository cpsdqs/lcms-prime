# Little CMS′
_LCMS: RESF Edition_

LCMS′ is a re-write of [Little CMS](http://littlecms.com) 2.9 in Rust.

There is no intention to stay faithful to the C version and this library may or may not deviate a lot in the future, but right now it’s fairly 1:1 (at least where it’s implemented) so it’ll just be called lcms-prime.

### Todo
- implement most of LCMS
